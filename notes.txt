TRAINING PIPELINE
=================

1. Train baseline model (source building, 2 years data):
   python src/train_baseline.py
   
2. Train pre-transfer model (target building, 8 weeks, from scratch):
   python src/train_pretransfer.py
   
3. Train transfer model (target building, 8 weeks, fine-tuned):
   python src/train_transfer.py

4. Optional - Train data efficiency models (1w, 2w, 4w, 8w, 16w):
   python train_data_efficiency.py
   
5. Evaluate all models:
   python evaluate_all_models.py

IMPORTANT NOTES
===============

- All models use STRATIFIED RANDOM SPLIT to avoid distribution mismatch
- Baseline: 2 years Rat_education_Colin, seq_length=168, 3 layers, 128 hidden
- Pre-Transfer & Transfer: 8 weeks Rat_education_Denise, seq_length=24, 2 layers, 64 hidden
- Pre-Transfer vs Transfer comparison shows pure transfer learning benefit
- Data Efficiency: Pre-Transfer & Transfer models with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 weeks of data

KNOWN ISSUES FIXED
==================

✓ Distribution mismatch (52% mean shift train→test) - Fixed with stratified split
✓ Early stopping too aggressive (patience=10) - Increased to 15
✓ Sequence too long (336 hours) - Reduced to 168 for baseline, 24 for limited data
✓ Model collapse in pre-transfer - Fixed with simpler architecture (64/2 vs 128/3)
✓ Negative R² on baseline - Fixed with stratified split ensuring similar distributions
